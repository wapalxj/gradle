    <issue
        id="StaticFieldLeak"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Do not place Android context classes in static fields (static reference to `SyncAdapter` which has field `mContext` pointing to `Context`); this is a memory leak (and also breaks Instant Run)"
        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Static Field Leaks"
        explanation="A static field will leak contexts.&#xA;&#xA;Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If that outer class is for example a `Fragment` or `Activity`, then this reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these longer running instances can cause leaks.&#xA;&#xA;ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts."

    <issue
        id="IconMissingDensityFolder"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Missing density variation folders in `src\\main\\res`: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-xxhdpi"
        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="3"
        summary="Missing density folder"
        explanation="Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as `drawable-hdpi`.&#xA;&#xA;Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"
